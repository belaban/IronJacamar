  <section id="testinggoals">
    <title>Overall goals</title>
    <para>The overall goals of our test environment is to execute tests that ensures that
    we have full coverage of the JCA specification as well as our implementation.</para>

    <section id="spectest">
      <title>Specification</title>
      <para>The purpose of the specification tests is to test our implementation against the
      actual specification text.</para>
      <para>Each test can only depend on:</para>
      <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
         <listitem>
            <para>The official Java Connector Architecture API (javax.resource)</para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>Interfaces and classes in the test suite that extends/implements 
            the official API</para>
         </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>The test cases should be created in such a way such that they are easily identified
        by chapter, section and paragraph. For example:</para>
      <programlisting>
org.jboss.jca.test.core.spec.chaper10.section3
      </programlisting>
    </section>

    <section id="jbinterfacetest">
      <title>JBoss specific interfaces</title>
      <para>The purpose of the JBoss specific interfaces tests is to test our specific interfaces.</para>
      <para>Each test can depend on:</para>
      <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
         <listitem>
            <para>The official Java Connector Architecture API (javax.resource)</para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>The JBoss JCA specific APIs (org.jboss.jca.xxx.api)</para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>Interfaces and classes in the test suite that extends/implements these APIs</para>
         </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>The test cases lives in a package that have a meaningful name of the component it tests. For example:</para>
      <programlisting>
org.jboss.jca.test.core.workmanager
      </programlisting>

      <para>These test cases can use both the embedded JCA environment or be implemented as standard POJO based
        JUnit test cases.</para>

    </section>

    <section id="jbimpltest">
      <title>JBoss specific implementation</title>
      <para>The purpose of the JBoss specific implementation tests is to test our specific implementation.
      These tests should cover all methods are not exposed through the interface.</para>
      <para>Each test can depend on:</para>
      <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
         <listitem>
            <para>The official Java Connector Architecture API (javax.resource)</para>

            <para>Interfaces and classes in the test suite</para>

      <para>The test cases lives in a package that have a meaningful name of the component it tests. For example:</para>

org.jboss.jca.test.core.workmanager
      </programlisting>

      <para>These test cases can use both the embedded JCA environment or be implemented as standard POJO based

  <section id="qa">
    <title>Quality Assurance</title>
    <para>In addition to the test suite the JBoss JCA project deploys various
      tools to increase the stability of the project.</para>
    <para>The following sections will describe each of these tools.</para>

    <section id="checkstyle">
      <title>Checkstyle</title>
      <para>Checkstyle is a tool that verifies that the formatting of the source
        code in the project is consistent.</para>

      <para>This allows for easier readability and a consistent feel of the project.</para>

      <para>The home of checkstyle is located here: <ulink url="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/"/>.</para>

      <para>The goal is to have zero errors in the report.</para>

    </section>

    <section id="findbugs">
      <title>Findbugs</title>
      <para>Findbugs is a tool that scans your project for bugs and provides reports based on its
        findings.</para>

      <para>This tool helps lower of the number of bugs found in the JBoss JCA project.</para>

      <para>The home of findbugs is located here: <ulink url="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/"/>.</para>

      <para>The goal is to have zero errors in the report and as few exclusions in the filter as possible.</para>

    </section>

    <section id="cobertura">
      <title>Cobertura</title>
      <para>Cobertura generates a test suite matrix for your project which helps you identify
        where you need additional test coverage.</para>

      <para>The reports that the tool provides makes sure that the JBoss JCA project has the correct test coverage.</para>

      <para>The home of Cobertura is located here: <ulink url="http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/"/>.</para>

      <para>The goal is to have as high code coverage as possible in all areas.</para>
