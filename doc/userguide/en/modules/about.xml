    <title>Why IronJacamar ?</title>

    <para>The Java EE Connector Architecture container can be viewed as a foundation inside an application server
      as it provides connectivity to the other containers such that they can communicate with EISes. Iron is offen
      used as foundation in building houses too.</para>

    <para>The Jacamar bird family which lives in Central and South America are glossy elegant birds with long bills 
      and tails. Why we picked the Jacamar family is left as an exercise for the reader :)</para>
